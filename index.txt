1488. Shortest distance

There are N villages, numbered 1 to N.

Between the villages, there are M undirected roads. The i-th road connects village Aᵢ and village Bᵢ, and its length is Cᵢ.

It is guaranteed that all villages are connected.

There are K villages with shops. The number of the j-th shop village is Xⱼ.

Then, there are Q queries. For the k-th query, you are given a village number Yₖ, and you need to determine the shortest distance from village Yₖ to its nearest shop.

Input format

The first line contains two integers N and M.

The next M lines each contain three integers Aᵢ, Bᵢ, Cᵢ, meaning that the i-th road connects villages Aᵢ and Bᵢ, with length Cᵢ.

The next line contains the integer K.

The next K lines each contain an integer Xⱼ, the number of a village with a shop.

The next line contains the integer Q.

The next Q lines each contain an integer Yₖ, the number of the village being queried.

Output format

For each query, output a single integer: the shortest distance from that village to the nearest shop.
