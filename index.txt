1488. Shortest distance

There are N villages, numbered 1 to N.

Between the villages, there are M undirected roads. The i-th road connects village Aᵢ and village Bᵢ, and its length is Cᵢ.

It is guaranteed that all villages are connected.

There are K villages with shops. The number of the j-th shop village is Xⱼ.

Then, there are Q queries. For the k-th query, you are given a village number Yₖ, and you need to determine the shortest distance from village Yₖ to its nearest shop.

Input format

The first line contains two integers N and M.

The next M lines each contain three integers Aᵢ, Bᵢ, Cᵢ, meaning that the i-th road connects villages Aᵢ and Bᵢ, with length Cᵢ.

The next line contains the integer K.

The next K lines each contain an integer Xⱼ, the number of a village with a shop.

The next line contains the integer Q.

The next Q lines each contain an integer Yₖ, the number of the village being queried.

Output format

For each query, output a single integer: the shortest distance from that village to the nearest shop.

Problem: Connect Tourist Attractions (Minimum Road Cost)

You are the mayor of a very old city with n major tourist attractions. The i-th
attraction is at 3D coordinates (xi, yi, zi).

To build a bidirectional road between two attractions A(x1, y1, z1) and
B(x2, y2, z2), the cost is:
    cost(A, B) = min( |x1 - x2|, |y1 - y2|, |z1 - z2| )

Build a network of roads so that it is possible to travel between any pair of
attractions (the graph is connected) and the total cost is minimized.
Return the minimum total cost.

Input format
- First line: integer n
- Next n lines: three integers xi yi zi for each attraction

Output format
- One integer: the minimum total cost to connect all attractions

CSES – Investigation

You are given a directed, weighted graph with nodes 1..n and m edges.
Each edge is a flight (a → b) with a non-negative cost c.

Task:
From node 1 to node n, compute the following:
1) The minimum total cost.
2) The number of distinct shortest paths (mod 1,000,000,007).
3) The minimum number of edges among all shortest paths.
4) The maximum number of edges among all shortest paths.

Two paths are considered different if their sequences of vertices/edges differ.
Only paths whose total cost equals the minimum cost are considered in (2)–(4).

Input:
- First line: n m
- Next m lines: a b c  (an edge from a to b with cost c)

Output:
- Four integers on one line:
  min_cost  count_mod  min_edges_on_shortest  max_edges_on_shortest

Constraints (typical):
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 1 ≤ m ≤ 2e5
- 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n
- 0 ≤ c ≤ 1e9
- Graph is directed; costs are non-negative (so Dijkstra applies).

Notes:
- Use Dijkstra from node 1 to obtain shortest distances.
- While relaxing edges, also maintain for each node:
  ways[v] = # of shortest paths to v (mod 1e9+7),
  mn[v]   = minimum edges on a shortest path to v,
  mx[v]   = maximum edges on a shortest path to v.

Your task is to find a minimum-price flight route from Syrjälä to Metsälä. You have one discount coupon, using which you can halve the price of any single flight during the route. However, you can only use the coupon once.
When you use the discount coupon for a flight whose price is x, its price becomes \lfloor x/2 \rfloor (it is rounded down to an integer).
Input
The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and flight connections. The cities are numbered 1,2,\ldots,n. City 1 is Syrjälä, and city n is Metsälä.
After this there are m lines describing the flights. Each line has three integers a, b, and c: a flight begins at city a, ends at city b, and its price is c. Each flight is unidirectional.
You can assume that it is always possible to get from Syrjälä to Metsälä.
Output
Print one integer: the price of the cheapest route from Syrjälä to Metsälä.

You are given a map of a labyrinth, and your task is to find a path from start to end. You can walk left, right, up and down.
Input
The first input line has two integers n and m: the height and width of the map.
Then there are n lines of m characters describing the labyrinth. Each character is . (floor), # (wall), A (start), or B (end). There is exactly one A and one B in the input.
Output
First print "YES", if there is a path, and "NO" otherwise.
If there is a path, print the length of the shortest such path and its description as a string consisting of characters L (left), R (right), U (up), and D (down). You can print any valid solution.

Syrjälä's network has n computers and m connections. Your task is to find out if Uolevi can send a message to Maija, and if it is possible, what is the minimum number of computers on such a route.
Input
The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of computers and connections. The computers are numbered 1,2,\dots,n. Uolevi's computer is 1 and Maija's computer is n.

Every connection is between two different computers, and there is at most one connection between any two computers.

Title: Connect Components at Minimum Cost

You are given an undirected graph with N vertices and M existing edges.
The graph may have multiple connected components. Each existing edge has a
positive weight w.

You may add new edges to connect different components. The cost to add an
edge between two components A and B is defined as:

    cost(A, B) = minEdge(A) + minEdge(B)

where minEdge(X) is the minimum weight among the existing edges that lie
inside component X.

Task
Compute the minimum total cost to make the whole graph connected by adding
edges under the above rule. If this is impossible (i.e., some component
contains no existing edge, so minEdge is undefined), output -1.

Input
- N M
- Next M lines: u v w  (1 ≤ u, v ≤ N; u ≠ v; w > 0)

Output
- A single integer: the minimum total cost to connect all components, or -1
  if not possible.

Constraints
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 2e5
- 0 ≤ M ≤ 2e5
- 1 ≤ w ≤ 1e9

Notes / Solution Idea
- Let the connected components be C1..Ck (k ≥ 1).
- For each Ci, compute mi = minEdge(Ci). If any Ci has no edges → print -1.
- If k = 1 → already connected → answer = 0.
- If k ≥ 2 → it is optimal to connect all components in a star using the
  component with the globally smallest mi.
  Minimum total cost:
      sum(mi for all i) + (k - 2) * min(mi)

Example
Input
5 2
1 2 7
4 5 3
Output
13
Explanation
Components: {1,2} with minEdge=7, {3} has no edges → impossible → -1.
(If vertex 3 had an edge inside its component, we would compute by the formula.)

Converging Maze: Largest Sum Cycle

You are given a maze with N cells. Each cell may have multiple entry points
but at most one exit (i.e., the entry/exit points are unidirectional doors).

The cells are numbered from 0 to N - 1.

You are also given an array edge[0..N-1] such that:
- If edge[i] = j (0 ≤ j < N), then there is a one-way passage from cell i to cell j.
- If edge[i] = -1, then cell i has no outgoing passage (it is an exit / dead-end).

Interpret this as a directed graph in which each node i has at most one outgoing edge.

Definition:
- A cycle is a path where you can start from some cell and, by repeatedly
  following the outgoing edges, eventually return to that same cell.
- The sum of a cycle is defined as the sum of the cell numbers (node indices)
  that lie on that cycle.

Task:
Find the maximum sum of any cycle in this graph.
If there are no cycles at all, return -1.

Input format:
1. The first line contains an integer N — the number of cells.
2. The second line contains N integers: edge[0], edge[1], ..., edge[N-1],
   where edge[i] is the index of the cell reachable from i, or -1 if i has no exit.

Output format:
Print a single integer — the sum of the largest-sum cycle in the maze,
or -1 if there is no cycle.

Example:
Input:
23
4 4 1 4 13 8 8 0 8 14 9 15 11 -1 10 15 22 22 22 22 22 21

Output:
45
