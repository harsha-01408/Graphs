1488. Shortest distance

There are N villages, numbered 1 to N.

Between the villages, there are M undirected roads. The i-th road connects village Aᵢ and village Bᵢ, and its length is Cᵢ.

It is guaranteed that all villages are connected.

There are K villages with shops. The number of the j-th shop village is Xⱼ.

Then, there are Q queries. For the k-th query, you are given a village number Yₖ, and you need to determine the shortest distance from village Yₖ to its nearest shop.

Input format

The first line contains two integers N and M.

The next M lines each contain three integers Aᵢ, Bᵢ, Cᵢ, meaning that the i-th road connects villages Aᵢ and Bᵢ, with length Cᵢ.

The next line contains the integer K.

The next K lines each contain an integer Xⱼ, the number of a village with a shop.

The next line contains the integer Q.

The next Q lines each contain an integer Yₖ, the number of the village being queried.

Output format

For each query, output a single integer: the shortest distance from that village to the nearest shop.

Data constraints

Problem: Connect Tourist Attractions (Minimum Road Cost)

You are the mayor of a very old city with n major tourist attractions. The i-th
attraction is at 3D coordinates (xi, yi, zi).

To build a bidirectional road between two attractions A(x1, y1, z1) and
B(x2, y2, z2), the cost is:
    cost(A, B) = min( |x1 - x2|, |y1 - y2|, |z1 - z2| )

Build a network of roads so that it is possible to travel between any pair of
attractions (the graph is connected) and the total cost is minimized.
Return the minimum total cost.

Input format
- First line: integer n
- Next n lines: three integers xi yi zi for each attraction

Output format
- One integer: the minimum total cost to connect all attractions

Sample Input
3
1 5 7
2 9 4
1 3 9

Sample Output
1

CSES – Investigation

You are given a directed, weighted graph with nodes 1..n and m edges.
Each edge is a flight (a → b) with a non-negative cost c.

Task:
From node 1 to node n, compute the following:
1) The minimum total cost.
2) The number of distinct shortest paths (mod 1,000,000,007).
3) The minimum number of edges among all shortest paths.
4) The maximum number of edges among all shortest paths.

Two paths are considered different if their sequences of vertices/edges differ.
Only paths whose total cost equals the minimum cost are considered in (2)–(4).

Input:
- First line: n m
- Next m lines: a b c  (an edge from a to b with cost c)

Output:
- Four integers on one line:
  min_cost  count_mod  min_edges_on_shortest  max_edges_on_shortest

Constraints (typical):
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 1 ≤ m ≤ 2e5
- 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n
- 0 ≤ c ≤ 1e9
- Graph is directed; costs are non-negative (so Dijkstra applies).

Notes:
- Use Dijkstra from node 1 to obtain shortest distances.
- While relaxing edges, also maintain for each node:
  ways[v] = # of shortest paths to v (mod 1e9+7),
  mn[v]   = minimum edges on a shortest path to v,
  mx[v]   = maximum edges on a shortest path to v.
